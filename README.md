# Style decisions
  In learning more about the crypto space, I noticed that many of the UI choices highlight gradient color schemes which immediately stood out to me! 
Dark blues with some off-set color pops really stand out to me, which explains my style choices throughout the website.

 Are there more intricate things I could have done? Absolutely. Will I continue to work on it and implement those additions in the future? Of course! For now, however, I wanted this to be the first draft I put out there.
