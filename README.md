This is my personal website!<br> 
As a former professional dancer turned barista trainer turned software engineer,<br>
this is a way to bridge part of my journey and the lessons learned over the years into a beautiful project!
This project was a combination of React/Typescript, and a ton of fun to make. Enjoy!

# Style decisions
  In learning more about the crypto space, I noticed that many of the UI choices highlight gradient color schemes which immediately stood out to me! 
Dark blues with some off-set color pops really stand out to me, which explains my style choices throughout the website.

# Keep it simple, silly!
  Something I have always appreciated is the simplicity behind gradients. I'm a huge fan of artists that utilize gradients
  in their art because of the tie in with life and the shifting of one period of time in one's life to another.

 Are there more intricate things I could have done? Absolutely. Will I continue to work on it and implement those additions in the future? Of course! For now, however, I wanted this to be the first draft I put out there.
 
 # Enjoy!
